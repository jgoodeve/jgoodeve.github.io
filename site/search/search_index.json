Welcome!"},{"location":"about/","title":"About Me","text":"<p>I was born and raised in Brentwood Bay, British Columbia, Canada, about 30 minutes from the provincial capital of Victoria on Vancouver Island. Growing up I became interested in all kinds of things - my Dad is a software engineer and a pilot, and encouraged me through school. I loved world history, creative writing, aviation and more. I did well in school, and became interested in astronomy and engineering through a spaceflight passion I developed between middle school and high school. Around this time I also learned to play acoustic and electric guitar. Amid the academic things I loved, I also took classes in musical theatre, advanced AP Literature, and participated in a project called 'Global Perspectives', a two year class about human issues in our own community and worldwide, which culminated in my paying my own way to travel to India and renovate an elementary school in Kerala province. While I was in middle and high school, I also began training as a private pilot. I got as far as my first solo (the first time a student flies a plane on their own) before the savings which would have gone towards the expensive training were put towards the aforementioned trip. </p> <p>I did my undergraduate degree at the University of Victoria (UVic), near where I grew up in Victoria, BC. My degree is a combined in physics and astronomy which I completed in the honours program, and was awarded with distinction. During the degree I was a part of various projects. I spent 8 months working full-time as a member of a working group creating video tutorials about a field of astronomy called Radio Interferometry for other astronomers. These videos are featured on the science website of one of the world's foremost observatories, the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), and at time of writing the continuing series has over 11,000 views on youtube (comparable to the size of the entire world's professional astronomical community). I also did 4 months of research, supervised by Dr. Justin Albert (UVic faculty), on the prospect of calibrating ground-based optical telescopes not with variable, distant calibration stars, but with precisely engineered low-earth-orbit (LEO) light sources. This is the subject of a first-author paper of mine in the final stages of review, and recommended for publication, with the American Astronomical Society (AAS) Journals.</p> <p>Since 2024, I've been a master's student in astronomy and astrophysics at the Trottier Space Institute, at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. I'm a part of the McGill Extreme Gravity and Accretion Group (MEGA), supervised by Dr. Daryl Haggard, and the Cosmic Dawn research group, supervised by Dr. Adrian Liu. My greatest interests are in cosmology, that is the study of the universe at its largest scales of time and space, and extreme gravity, caused by objects like black holes and neutron stars. In my ongoing Master's research, I'm evaluating how an upcoming cutting-edge cosmology telescope, the Canadian Hydrogen Observatory and Radio Transient Detector (CHORD), could be used to look for long radio transients; come-and-go flashes of bright radio emission caused by a range of extreme astrophysical events, the study of which provides insight into fundamental physics.</p> <p>I'm passionate about a great deal of things, and I'm determined to find my way to a life where I can enjoy and explore all of them, from advancing our understanding of our universe, to music and more. </p>"},{"location":"about/#outside-of-academia","title":"Outside of Academia","text":"<ul> <li>I'm a guitarist, singer and songwriter.

This is in contrast to typical techniques, where the brightness of a star or similar natural source is used. The brightness of these sources can vary appreciably with time, and so care has to be taken to monitor them closely. During this research, I wrote a Python package, 'Streaktools', which allows users to simulate the addition of realistic light-streaks, which would be caused by flashing artificial light sources in orbit, into real astronomical images. The code also allows for these simulated streaks, and real streaks, to be used for photometric calibration.

I created a suite of ideal interferometric images of circumstellar debris disks around nearby stars using existing ALMA data, resolving the thermal glow created by the fine dust orbiting the star. This was done to help Dr. Matthews' PhD student, Katie Crotts, search for signatures of otherwise undetectable planets around these stars, since their gravity can affect the shape of the disk.

In recent years, much attention has been directed towards the study of long radio transients, bursts of radio emission believed to be caused by a range of extreme astrophysical events:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The deaths of massive stars, supernovae, can produce extremely energetic jets of material, shot out at relativistic speeds, along the axis of the star's rotation. The immediate event leads to long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), which last from seconds to minutes, but in the aftermath the jet of extremely hot material collides with the local interstellar medium and produces radiation spanning the whole electromagnetic spectrum as ejected electrons spiral around magnetic field lines. The radio afterglow created by this 'Synchrotron emission', which can last for years, is an independent window into the study of these events from the monitoring of the GRB itself.</p> </li> <li> <p>Supermassive black holes (SMBHs), now believed to exist in the core of nearly every major galaxy, occasionally tear apart stars that pass too close, beginning a sort of feeding frenzy. These are called 'tidal disruption events' (TDEs), and create a radio transient with a similar mechanism to the supernovae, as the SMBH winds up a relativistic jet in a similar manner. This may be complemented by radio emission that does not come from the jetted material, as some of the shredded star is flung into the surrounding medium.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The study of the radio transients associated with these events is of great scientific value to the study of these phenomena. In the majority of cases, the electromagnetic radiation we receive is the only information we can use to study them; the event itself is far too small on the sky to resolve what is physically going on. Until recently these events were almost exclusively detected by observations in high-energy light (UV, X-ray, and gamma ray), but the next generation of radio telescopes have the potential to help monitor and observe these events. This can help massively to constrain our models and simulations of what is actually going on (since the radio emission mechanism is different from that of the higher energy light), can help greatly to positively identify these events (TDEs, for example, can look an awful lot like GRBs but necessarily occur in the centers of what could be very distant galaxies - the high resolution images radio astronomy can help confirm that the transient came from the centre of a galaxy), and overcomes several other challenges with short-wavelength astronomy. Radio astronomy can be done from the ground with larger telescopes, whereas the UV and higher energy light used to otherwise monitor these events is (thankfully) blocked almost completely by our atmosphere, necessitating the use of high-demand, low-resolution space-based telescopes. Radio observations may also allow us to detect otherwise hidden events, since light more energetic than infrared is absorbed by galactic dust, whereas radio light passes unimpeded.</p> <p>All of these factors make radio astronomy, and especially radio interferometry, a promising and potentially very useful way of studying these phenomena.</p>"},{"location":"reasearch/#my-research","title":"My Research","text":"<p>For my master's research project, I am predicting how many long radio transients of many types we may be able to see with one of the world's best, up and coming, radio observatories, the Canadian Hydrogen Observatory and Radio Transient Detector (CHORD), which is currently under construction at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory in Penticton, BC, Canada. Several factors will make this radio interferometer an excellent tool for searching for long radio transients:</p> <ul> <li> <p>CHORD will have an unusually large field of view for a radio interferometer.
