# Introduction

Hi! I'm a Master's student in Astrophysics at the Trottier Space Institute, at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. I focus on radio interferometry, and my current research, supervised by Dr. Adrian Liu and Dr. Daryl Haggard, is focused on forecasting how well Canada's upcoming flagship radio telescope, the Canadian Hydrogen Observatory and Radio Transient Detector (CHORD), will be able to search for and find long radio transients caused by accreting binaries, tidal disruption events active galactic nuclei, and gamma ray bursts.
