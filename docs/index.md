Welcome to my personal academic website! I'm Josh - I'm a master's student in astronomy at the Trottier Space Institute at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. I'm at the beginning of an exciting career in space science - I've created videos about radio interferometry for radio astronomers, I've done research (currently in the final stages of publication) about using artificial light sources in orbit around the Earth to calibrate ground based telescopes and enable all kinds of observations, and now I'm beginning my own research at the intersection of my three greatest scentific passions - cosmology, extreme gravity and radio interferometry, which you can learn about in [my research](./research/research_index.md). 

Besides being an astronomer, I'm an avid musician - this is another part of my life I'm trying to expand into. I've also ridden motorcycles on racetracks, am partway through my private pilot's license, and love the outdoors.

<div align = 'center'>This website is meant to convey who I am in all respects - academically and personally. Welcome!
